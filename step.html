  <h2> Step with me</h2>
<p>Is this happening to me?
Have I lost all my defenses?
Should I wait around and see
What it's like to lose my senses?
Always looking for a chance
From the high ground to the ditches
But the chance I'll never miss
Now I know what happiness is
This love's delicious
Like home-cooked dishes
I'm tasting mischievously
Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you baby
Three steps away from me
Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets</p>

<p>Now come along and step with me
Sun is shining up ahead
In thirty years we'll still be happy
Making movies in my head
Making Hollywood look tiny
Don't know why but all your words
Sound just like a melody
From the pieces that I've heard
I could build a symphony
This love's delicious
Like home-cooked dishes
I'm tasting mischievously
Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you baby
Three steps away from me
Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come on and step with me
Step 1, I don't even know you
Step 2, come a little closer
Step 3, you can't even see you're
Three steps from loving me
Step 1, come a little closer
Step 2, rest upon my shoulder
Step 3, I'm calling you baby
Three steps away from me
Step 4, we can get married
Step 5, top it with a cherry
Step 6, as good as it gets
Now come along and step with me
Three steps three steps</p>
