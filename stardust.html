  <h2> Stardust</h2>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/CD8vrLlpZLo" target="_blank" title="영상">*</a> I could be staring at somebody new
    But stuck in my head is a picture of you
    You are the thunder, I was the rain
    I wanna know if I'll see you again
    I said I love you, you said goodbye
    Everything changes in the blink of an eye
    It's been a while, I still carry the flame
    I wanna know if I'll see you again
    See you again, see you again</p>

    <p style="margin-top:10px">Want you to know, what you mean to me
    What will it take, take you to see?
    <strong>I could a little stardust in your eyes
    Put a little sunshine in your life</strong>
    Give me a little heart and feel the same
    And I wanna know if I'll see you again
    See you again
    I've seen that before, cause you're not even there
    I'm writing this song and you don't even care
    Throw me a lifeline and open my door
    And pick up my heart that you left on the floor
    On the floor, on the floor
    Want you to know, what you mean to me
    What will it take, take you to see?
    I could a little stardust in your eyes
    Put a little sunshine in your life
    Give me a little heart and feel the same
    And I wanna know if I'll see you again
    See you again</p>
    <p>Call me all the time is rushing by
    And all the little things we leave behind
    But even that do, is a little bit of me, a little bit of you
    When will I see you again?
    When will I see you again?
    When will I see you again?
    When will I see you again?
    I could a little stardust in your eyes
    Put a little sunshine in your life
    Give me a little heart and feel the same
    And I wanna know if I'll see you again
    See you again
    I could a little stardust in your eyes
    Put a little sunshine in your life
    Give me a little heart and feel the same
    And I wanna know if I'll see you again
    See you again
    Call me all the time is rushing by
    And all the little things we leave behind
    But even that...do, is a little bit of me, a little bit of you
    When will I see you again?
    When will I see you again?</p>
